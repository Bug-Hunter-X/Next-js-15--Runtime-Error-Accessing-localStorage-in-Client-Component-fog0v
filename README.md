# Next.js 15 localStorage Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications when interacting with `localStorage` within client-side components. The issue arises because `localStorage` may not be available during the initial rendering phase, leading to runtime errors. 

## Problem
The `about.js` file attempts to access and parse data from `localStorage`. If the `localStorage` item does not exist, or if the data is not correctly formatted JSON, the application will throw an error. This is especially problematic when directly navigating to `/about`. 

## Solution
The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates how to mitigate this issue using optional chaining and a default value to handle the case where localStorage data is not available or improperly formatted.
